## Pretext

Internal notes for contributors and agents. Use `README.md` as the public source of truth for API examples, benchmark/accuracy numbers, and user-facing limitations. Use `RESEARCH.md` for the detailed exploration log.

### Commands

- `bun start` — serve pages at http://localhost:3000
- `bun run check` — typecheck + lint
- `bun test` — headless tests (HarfBuzz, 100% accuracy)

### Important files

- `src/layout.ts` — core library; keep `layout()` fast and allocation-light
- `src/measure-harfbuzz.ts` — HarfBuzz backend for headless tests
- `src/test-data.ts` — shared corpus for browser accuracy, headless tests, and benchmarks
- `src/layout.test.ts` — Bun tests for consistency and word-sum accuracy
- `pages/accuracy.ts` — browser sweep plus per-line diagnostics
- `pages/benchmark.ts` — performance comparisons
- `pages/bubbles.ts` — bubble shrinkwrap demo

### Implementation notes

- `prepare()` / `prepareWithSegments()` do horizontal-only work. `layout()` / `layoutWithLines()` take explicit `lineHeight`.
- `layout()` is the resize hot path: no DOM reads, no canvas calls, no string work, and avoid gratuitous allocations.
- Word width cache is `Map<font, Map<segment, width>>`; shared across texts and resettable via `clearCache()`.
- Word and grapheme segmenters are hoisted at module scope. Any locale reset should also clear the word cache.
- Punctuation is merged into preceding word-like segments only, never into spaces.
- Non-word, non-space segments are break opportunities, same as words.
- CJK grapheme splitting plus kinsoku merging keeps prohibited punctuation attached to adjacent graphemes.
- Emoji correction is auto-detected per font size, constant per emoji grapheme, and effectively font-independent.
- Bidi levels are computed during `prepare()` and stored, but `layout()` does not currently consume them.
- Supported CSS target is the default: `white-space: normal`, `word-break: normal`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`, `line-break: auto`.
- `system-ui` is unsafe for accuracy; canvas and DOM can resolve different fonts on macOS.
- Thai can still mismatch because CSS and `Intl.Segmenter` use different internal dictionaries.
- HarfBuzz headless tests need explicit LTR to avoid wrong direction on isolated Arabic words.

### Open questions

- Locale switch: expose a way to reinitialize the hoisted segmenters and clear cache for a new locale.
- `layoutWithLines()` may want ranges/indices instead of `{ text, width }` to avoid materializing substrings.
- ASCII fast path could skip some CJK, bidi, and emoji overhead.
- Benchmark methodology still needs review.
- `pages/demo.html` is still a placeholder.
- Additional CSS configs are still untested: `break-all`, `keep-all`, `strict`, `loose`, `anywhere`, `pre-wrap`.
